          My name is Alexander Zhu, prospective software engineer.
          I'm currently studying at UC San Diego as a computer engineering major.
          I'm interested in a multitude of fields within computer science,
          such as cybersecurity and web development, though I'm open to working
          in any department of computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
          I find nearly all matters relating to computer science and/or
          programming to be interesting; I enjoy working on challenging
          projects, and many projects that I've worked on have been a great
          source of motivation. Some examples of projects I've worked on
          can be seen by clicking the "Projects" tab above.
